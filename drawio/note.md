# How to get clear figure to present in ppt

Use pdf export. Note that the exported svg file can be viewed using chrome and then export into the pdf file. Since after importing the pdf file into the ppt, it maintains vector format, you can zoom in/out without losing resolution. Then, you can crop into the image. 

Another way is when print into the pdf, you can select custom print and use legal letter and landscape. That gives you a great result.
