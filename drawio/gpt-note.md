# Is pdf also vector formats without losing information

Yes, your observation is correct! When you save an `.svg` (Scalable Vector Graphics) file into a `.pdf`, the image remains sharp when inserted into PowerPoint because both `.svg` and `.pdf` are **vector-based formats**. Vector graphics are resolution-independent, meaning they can scale up or down without losing quality, unlike raster formats like `.png`, which can become blurry when resized.

On the other hand, **`.png`** is a raster (bitmap) image format, meaning it’s made up of pixels. When you insert a `.png` into PowerPoint and resize it, the quality can degrade (blurriness occurs) since the resolution is fixed.

### How to Select a Certain Area of an SVG and Export It to PDF:

If you want to select a specific area of an `.svg` file and export just that part to `.pdf`, you can use tools like **Inkscape** or other vector-editing software. Here’s how to do it using Inkscape:

#### Steps to Export a Selected Area in Inkscape:

1. **Open the SVG in Inkscape**:
   - Open your `.svg` file in **Inkscape**. You can download and install Inkscape using Homebrew with:
     ```bash
     brew install --cask inkscape
     ```

2. **Select the Area You Want**:
   - Use the **selection tool** (shortcut `F1`) in Inkscape to select the part of the image you want to export.
   - You can select specific objects or a group of objects by dragging around them or clicking on them individually.

3. **Resize the Canvas to Fit the Selection**:
   - To make the canvas fit only the selected part, go to `File > Document Properties` (or press `Shift+Ctrl+D`).
   - Under the **"Custom Size"** section, click on the **"Resize page to content"** button, and select **"Resize page to drawing or selection"**. This will resize the canvas to fit the selected area.

4. **Export to PDF**:
   - Go to `File > Save As` or `File > Export`.
   - Choose **PDF** as the file format.
   - In the PDF export options, make sure to check **"Use exported object's size"** or similar, so that it exports only the selected area.

5. **Save and Insert into PowerPoint**:
   - Once the PDF is saved, you can insert the `.pdf` file into PowerPoint using `Insert > Picture > Picture from File`.

### Benefits of PDF Over PNG:
- **Scalability**: As both `.pdf` and `.svg` are vector formats, you maintain the sharpness and quality even when scaling the image.
- **Editing**: If necessary, you can still manipulate the vector elements in programs like Inkscape before exporting.

By selecting a specific area of your `.svg` file and exporting it to PDF, you ensure that only the desired part of the graphic is saved, maintaining its vector quality in PowerPoint. Let me know if you need further clarification!
