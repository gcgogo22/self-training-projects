## Some understanding of using remote repo

- In your root directory which is a git project. You can use submodules for remote repos. Submodule has its own .git and links to its own remote repo. However, the change difference of submodule can be tracked in your git project. 

- In order to have and work with all branches of submodule. You need to explicitly fetch all remote branches. <code> git fetch all </code>

- In order to keep a copy of your submodule with all its branches. I believe, you can add another remote repo and push all the materials.
